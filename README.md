This widget uses Flickr which is a Yahoo! company, and which offers free hosting your photos. Flickr generates multiple resolutions for the user to view, it allows you to create albums, and it has several ways to upload photos easily even in a raw format.

There are other solutions to display a gallery or slideshow in [Silex website builder](http://www.silex.me), for example you can grab the embed code of one of the [Simple Viewer's galleries](http://www.simpleviewer.net/products/) and paste it into an HTML box in Silex.
